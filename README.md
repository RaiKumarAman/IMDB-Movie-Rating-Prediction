# IMDB-Movie-Rating-Prediction

**Movie Rating Prediction Model**

### Overview:
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting movie ratings based on various features such as genre, cast, director, etc. The model is trained on a dataset of movie ratings and corresponding attributes.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-rating-prediction.git
  

2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Dataset:
The dataset used for training the model is included in this repository. However, you can also obtain a similar dataset from various sources such as Kaggle or IMDb.

### Usage:
1. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory.
2. Open the `Movie_Rating_Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.

### Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared value. These metrics are displayed in the notebook along with visualizations for better understanding.

### Prediction:
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the ratings of new movies by providing their attributes such as genre, cast, director, etc., as input to the model.
